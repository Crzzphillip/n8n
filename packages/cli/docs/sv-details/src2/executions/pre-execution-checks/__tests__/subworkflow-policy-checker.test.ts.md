### src2/executions/pre-execution-checks/__tests__/subworkflow-policy-checker.test.ts

Overview: src2/executions/pre-execution-checks/__tests__/subworkflow-policy-checker.test.ts participates in the execution pipeline, coordinating workflow runs, status, and results.

How it works: Components in this area interop with the workflow runner, active execution tracking, lifecycle hooks, and persistence to the database. They manage cancellations, timeouts, streaming, and error finalization.

Why it’s designed this way: Decoupling orchestration from transport allows sv to support inline and queued runs uniformly, improving resilience and scalability.

This component follows sv’s dependency-injection and modular architecture to keep responsibilities focused and testable. Decorators (e.g., @Service, @RestController, @Command) make wiring explicit while deferring lifecycle and registration to the container.
