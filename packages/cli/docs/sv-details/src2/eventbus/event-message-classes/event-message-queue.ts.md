### src2/eventbus/event-message-classes/event-message-queue.ts

Overview: src2/eventbus/event-message-classes/event-message-queue.ts is part of sv’s eventing layer, emitting and relaying internal events (e.g., logs, job signals).

How it works: Producers publish events that relays forward to subscribers or push transports. This enables decoupled observability and collaboration features.

Why it’s designed this way: Event-driven boundaries reduce coupling and enable cross-cutting features (telemetry, streaming) without contaminating domain logic.

This component follows sv’s dependency-injection and modular architecture to keep responsibilities focused and testable. Decorators (e.g., @Service, @RestController, @Command) make wiring explicit while deferring lifecycle and registration to the container.
